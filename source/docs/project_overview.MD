### Sound

We have decided to use simple 8-bit sounds for now.

With a Flash enabled browser [here](https://www.bfxr.net/ "Web based sound creation") is the tool for creating sound.
Alternatively you can download and use the EXE [here](http://drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html "Original sound creation kit").

If the browser works you should get an image like this:
